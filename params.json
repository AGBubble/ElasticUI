{"name":"ElasticUI","tagline":"AngularJS directives for Elasticsearch","body":"ElasticUI\r\n=========\r\n\r\nElasticUI is a set of AngularJS directives making it easy to rapidly build a frontend on top of Elasticsearch. It builds upon the elastic.js implementation of the Elasticsearch DSL.\r\n\r\n**The concept of ElasticUI is to have one \"view\" of your index to which you can add aggregations, sorting, paging, filters by adding directives in your html.**\r\n\r\nGetting started (demo file)\r\n---\r\nThe easiest way to get started is to checkout the [demo file][3]. This file demonstrates a simple use of facets, search and pagination. Just change 4 fields in the source to match your Elasticsearch setup and mapping.\r\n\r\n[Read more about the widgets used in the demo][4].\r\n\r\nCreating a project from scratch\r\n---\r\nAdd the following files to your Angular project:\r\n - elasticui.js from dist/\r\n - elastic.js from [fullscale/elastic.js][1]\r\n - elasticsearch.angular.js from [elasticsearch.org][2]\r\n\r\nSet up ElasticUI in your project by defining your ElasticSearch host as *euiHost*:\r\n\r\n    angular.module('yourApp', ['elasticui']).constant('euiHost', 'http://localhost:9200');\r\n\r\nSet the `eui-index=\"INDEX_NAME\"` on the `<body>` tag, now you can get started adding ElasticUI components to your view (see below).\r\n\r\nComponents\r\n===\r\nThe directives you can use for aggregations (facets), sorting, paging and filtering your view are documented in [docs/components.md][5]\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\n===\r\nExample dashboard built on top of this project:\r\n\r\n![World Cup Twitter Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YousefED/ElasticUI/master/docs/example_twitter_dashboard.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://github.com/fullscale/elastic.js\r\n  [2]: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/browser-builds.html\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/YousefED/ElasticUI/blob/master/examples/demo/demo.html\r\n  [4]: https://github.com/YousefED/ElasticUI/blob/master/docs/widgets.md\r\n  [5]: https://github.com/YousefED/ElasticUI/blob/master/docs/components.md\r\n","google":"UA-51691091-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
